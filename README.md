# Graph Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository explores the use of Graph Machine Learning (GML) techniques for detecting credit card fraud, with a focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) like GraphSAGE and alternate GNN models specifically tailored for this task.

## Project Description

We tackle the challenge of credit card fraud detection by applying advanced graph-based machine learning models. These models are designed to identify complex patterns of fraudulent transactions that are often missed by traditional detection methods.

## Repository Structure

- `Graph-Implementation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with our main GraphSAGE implementation adapted for fraud detection.
- `Alternate-Implementation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook featuring a specialized GNN model based on the methods discussed in Sheng's paper for enhanced fraud detection.
- `Paper.pdf`: Our detailed study document that discusses the theoretical aspects, methodology, and results.
- `Survey.pdf`: A survey of various GML techniques applied in the domain of fraud detection.

## Key Features

- **Graph Construction**: Builds transaction graphs from simulated credit card transaction data.
- **GraphSAGE Implementation**: Applies the GraphSAGE algorithm to analyze transaction graphs for fraud detection.
- **Modified GNN Model**: Implements a specialized GNN from Sheng's research to tackle specific challenges in credit card fraud detection.
